# ravy-undergraduate-thesis-codes
Code implementing the derivations and calculations of all key quantities used in the thesis, including reaction rates, energy loss rates, and neutrino spectra, based on Wolfram Mathematica notebooks.

"NeuPairAmp.nb" calculated the squared matrix amplitude.

"NeuPairCS.nb" calculated the cross section.

"NeuPairRQJ.nb" calculated the neutrino emission quantities, such as reaction rates (R), energy loss rates (Q), and second moment of energy rate (J).

Note that this is only valid in the pair-annihilation process in the thesis. For other particle processes, the codes must be adjusted.
